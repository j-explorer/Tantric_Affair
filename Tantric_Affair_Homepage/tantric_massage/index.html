          <p class="p_heading"><u>Tantric Energetics Massage - Trial session protocol</u></p>
          Our trial session is a 90 minute session. This form of practice is highly recommended through the packaging system, which helps you understand more about Tantra and it equally helps you to get as much benefit as possible. Like with any other training, consistency is important to be able to fully allow a tantric journey to unravel. 
        </p>
          
        <p>
          We begin the session with consultation and intention setting. It is important to have think prior to your session with us what would you like to achieve with this practise. This is followed by meditation, where we deepen the connection with our spirit body.  We also end the session with meditation. Meditation allows you to connect with yourself, ground your energy and calm your mind especially if you’ve had a busy and stressful day and expand your Ka body (your light forcefield). We also bring into the session some gentle yogic stretches to help you open into your hips and pelvis region.
        </p>

        <p>
          The massage comes a little bit later into the session to attune you deeper to your sensations. The purpose of the massage is to open you up deeper into your feeling body, where it can safely begin to grow and expand. It is through allowing yourself to feel the emotions deeper without fear of judgment that healing and relaxation begins to happen. Through this method we are cultivating the action of feeling deeper into yourself as its the main ingredient of manifesting great wealth and abundance. Massage is gentle, firm with very sensual strokes around your genital area. The therapist also introduces soothing sounds, warm oils and aromatherapy to deepen your relaxation. You will be often reminded throughout the session to breathe mindfully through your arousals. The conscious breathing calms your mind which helps you to activate sexual energy that stimulates and massages your inner organs. The creative sexual energy that we are activating is called the kundalini energy. It is recommended to retain your semon during this practice however we do understand that relieving yourself is the vital part to your relaxation process, as its something you have grown accustomed to. If you do feel called to learn more about semon retention and training we would be here to assist you.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Kundalini energy resides in our genetil area, around hips and pelvis. In our root chakra, connecting us with the earth, keeping us grounded. What happens when we begin to activate this area in our hips through movement and breath, the arousal and excitement starts to build up within us. This excitement is our creative, sexual energy being awakened and activated. This powerful and potent sexual energy is called kundalini in ancient hindu scriptures. It starts to rise up through your spinal column towards the crown center, making your whole body feel shivery, tingly and upgraded. It's very normal to go through these sensations, just stay observant of your experience and breathe. Kundalini energy heightens your state of being, it's an elevation of your consciousness. It's the energy that helps you activate your highest potential. Some might experience visions and opening of the  third eye center (mind’s eye), your intuition being stronger and vivid dreams. Our very intention with this practice is to help you unlock this energy, understand it and start to anchor this powerful state of being of confidence, wealth and inner-wisdom into your everyday life.

        <p>
          Tantra is a great tool if you are struggling with premature ejaculation or you are experiencing the opposite, difficult to orgasm. Difficulty to orgasm is mainly caused by chronic stress and anxiety. When we are stressed on an ongoing basis our energetic channels become blocked, the fresh flow of prana (chi), life force energy can not move through the channels to allow the body to self regulate stress levels, the result of this is that our nervous system begins to feel overloaded and manic causing our physical body to either feel super sensitive or shut down.

          <p class="p_heading"><u>Semon Retention</u></p>
           In Daoist tradition, a very popular tantric method for men is to orgasm without releasing the semen. Semen is a potent liquid and full of vital minerals. If one can learn to separate orgasm from the ejaculation one can enjoy a long and healthy life. It is achievable through practice, discipline and patience.  We can help you with that if it is something that interests you.
